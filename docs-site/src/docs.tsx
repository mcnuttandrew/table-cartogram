        <p>
          Table cartograms are a type of data visualization that represents tables of data as grid of
          quadrilaterals. They look a lot like if you were a heatmap were area-ed rather than colored. They
          may look really unconventional, but they have a surprisingly wide collection of uses, ranging from
          calendars, to pivot tables, and many others. They facilitate part-to-whole and part-to-part
          comparisons, in a similar manner as a pie chart, as well as offer specific detail look up, as in a
          traditional table or heatmap. Together these properties can make really interesting displays.
        </p>
        <p>
          table-cartogram.ts is a javascript/typescript library that enables easy web-based construction of
          these usual structures. This is the documentation page for that library.
